=head1 NAME

dos2unix - DOS/Mac to Unix and vice versa text file format converter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    dos2unix [options] [FILE ...] [-n INFILE OUTFILE ...]
    unix2dos [options] [FILE ...] [-n INFILE OUTFILE ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Dos2unix package includes utilities C<dos2unix> and C<unix2dos> to convert
plain text files in DOS or Mac format to Unix format and vice versa. Binary files
and non-regular files, such as soft links, are automatically skipped, unless
conversion is forced.

Dos2unix was modeled after dos2unix under SunOS/Solaris and has a few similar
conversion modes.

In DOS/Windows text files a line break, also known as newline, is a combination
of two characters: a Carriage Return (CR) followed by a Line Feed (LF). In Unix
text files a line break is a single character: the Line Feed (LF). In Mac text
files, prior to Mac OS X, a line break was single Carriage Return (CR)
character. Nowadays Mac OS uses Unix style (LF) line breaks.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-ascii>

Convert only line breaks. This is the default conversion mode.

Conversion between DOS and ISO character set. See also section
CONVERSION MODES.

I<ascii>, I<7bit>, I<iso>, I<mac>
with ascii being the default.

=item B<-f, --force>

Force conversion of all files. Also binary files.

=item B<-h, --help>

=item B<-l, --newline>

Add additional newline.

B<dos2unix>: Only DOS line breaks are changed to two Unix line breaks.
In Mac mode only Mac line breaks are changed to two Unix
line breaks.

B<unix2dos>: Only Unix line breaks are changed to two DOS line breaks.
In Mac mode Unix line breaks are changed to two Mac line breaks.

=item B<-n, --newfile INFILE OUTFILE ...>

New file mode. Convert file INFILE and write output to file OUTFILE.
File names must be given in pairs and wildcard names should I<not> be
used or you I<will> lose your files.

=item B<-o, --oldfile FILE ...>

Old file mode. Convert file FILE and overwrite output to it. The program
default to run in this mode. Wildcard names may be used.

=item B<-q, --quiet>

Quiet mode. Suppress all warnings and messages.

=item B<-V, --version>

Display version information and exit.

=back

=head1 MAC MODE

In normal mode line breaks are converted from DOS to Unix and vice versa. Mac line breaks are not converted.

In Mac mode line breaks are converted from Mac to Unix and vice versa. DOS line breaks are not changed.

To run in Mac mode use the command-line option C<-c mac> or use the commands C<mac2unix> or C<unix2mac>.

=head1 CONVERSION MODES

Conversion modes I<ascii>, I<7bit>, and I<iso>
are similar to those of dos2unix/unix2dos under SunOS/Solaris.

=over 4

=item B<ascii>

In mode C<ascii> only line breaks are converted. This is the default conversion
mode.

Although the name of this mode is ASCII, which is a 7 bit standard, the actual
mode is 8 bit. Use always this mode when converting Unicode UTF-8 files.

=item B<7bit>

In this mode all 8 bit non-ASCII characters (with values from 128 to 255) are
converted to a 7 bit space.

=item B<iso>

Characters are converted between a DOS character set (code page) and ISO
character set ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) on Unix. DOS characters without ISO-8859-1
equivalent, for which conversion is not possible, are converted to a dot. The
same counts for ISO-8859-1 characters without DOS counterpart.

The default DOS code page used is CP437, which is mainly used in the USA. In
Western Europe CP850 is more standard.  Windows code page CP1252 is also
supported. For other code pages use dos2unix in combination with iconv(1).
Iconv can convert between a long list of character encodings.

Some examples:

Convert from DOS CP437 to Unix Latin-1

    dos2unix -iso -n in.txt out.txt

Convert from DOS CP850 to Unix Latin-1

    dos2unix -850 -n in.txt out.txt

Convert from Windows CP1252 to Unix Latin-1

    dos2unix -1252 -n in.txt out.txt

Convert from Windows CP1252 to Unix UTF-8 (Unicode)

    iconv -f CP1252 -t UTF-8 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

Convert from Windows UTF-16 (Unicode) to Unix UTF-8 (Unicode)

    iconv -f UTF-16 -t UTF-8 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

Convert from Unix Latin-1 to DOS CP437

    unix2dos -iso -n in.txt out.txt

Convert from Unix Latin-1 to DOS CP850

    unix2dos -850 -n in.txt out.txt

Convert from Unix Latin-1 to Windows CP1252

    unix2dos -1252 -n in.txt out.txt

Convert from Unix UTF-8 (Unicode) to Windows CP1252

    unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f UTF-8 -t CP1252 > out.txt

Convert from Unix UTF-8 (Unicode) to Windows UTF-16 (Unicode)

    unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16 > out.txt

=head1 UNICODE

There exist different Unicode encodings. On Unix/Linux Unicode files are mostly
encoded in UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is ASCII compatible. UTF-8 files can have DOS,
Unix or Mac line breaks. It is safe to run dos2unix/unix2dos on UTF-8 encoded
files. On Windows mostly UTF-16 encoding is used for Unicode files.
Dos2unix/unix2dos should not be run on UTF-16 files. UTF-16 files are
automatically skipped, because they are considered binary.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Read input from 'stdin' and write output to 'stdout'.

    dos2unix

=head1 LOCALIZATION

=over 4

=item B<LANG>

The primary language is selected with the environment variable LANG. The LANG
variable consists out of several parts. The first part is in small letters the
language code. The second is optional and is the country code in capital
letters, preceded with an underscore. There is also an optional third part:
character encoding, preceded with a dot. A few examples for POSIX standard type
shells:

    export LANG=nl               Dutch
    export LANG=nl_NL            Dutch, The Netherlands
    export LANG=nl_BE            Dutch, Belgium
    export LANG=es_ES            Spanish, Spain
    export LANG=es_MX            Spanish, Mexico
    export LANG=en_US.iso88591   English, USA, Latin-1 encoding
    export LANG=en_GB.UTF-8      English, UK, UTF-8 encoding

For a complete list of language and country codes see the gettext manual:
L<http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Language-Codes>

On Unix systems you can use to command locale(1) to get locale specific
information.

=item B<LANGUAGE>

With the LANGUAGE environment variable you can specify a priority list of
languages, separated by colons. Dos2unix gives preference to LANGUAGE over LANG.
For instance, first Dutch and then German: C<LANGUAGE=nl:de>. You have to first
enable localization, by setting LANG (or LC_ALL) to a value other than
"C", before you can use a language priority list through the LANGUAGE
variable. See also the gettext manual:
L<http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#The-LANGUAGE-variable>

For Esperanto there is a special language file in x-method format. X-method can
be used on systems that don't support Latin-3 or Unicode character encoding.
Make LANGUAGE equal to "eo-x:eo".

If you select a language which is not available you will get the
standard English messages.


=item B<DOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR>

With the environment variable DOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR the LOCALEDIR set
during compilation can be overruled. LOCALEDIR is used to find the
language files. The GNU default value is C</usr/local/share/locale>.
Option B<--version> will display the LOCALEDIR that is used.

Example (POSIX shell):

    export DOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR=$HOME/share/locale
